# Game
# My first python project
# Purpose was to practice what I had learned from a CodeAcademy course, learn more about coding and using python, and just for enjoyment.
# Very little functional code was deleted in the master script file. Instead, I just continued to go down the file and include more.
# This allowed me a convenient way where I could track my progress for fun. The downside is nothing about this project is pretty.
